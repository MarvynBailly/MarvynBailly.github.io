Both used to further my understanding on how to set up this project. But I will create my own code for this project. 

If you click somewhere x amount of particles are created.
They move around a little.

When you double click an Attractor is created.
Attractor have a random amount of force indecated by their color.

Particles contrails mirror the attractor color. 
If multiple attractors, a mix of colors.
When over come by one force the color changes
