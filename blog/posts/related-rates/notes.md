So the idea is to make a related rates "game." The first idea I have is to try and keep a camera on a car by rotating it. The player will have to figure out how fast to move the camera to stay focused on the car. I'm going to use javascript and the p5js library to make the game playable on the web browser.

## Car Speed 
I'm liking the idea of the player being a cop trying to catch a speeding car. Let's begin by figuring out the speed of the car using the Doppler Effect which shifts the frequency by 
$$
\delta f = \frac{2 v}{\lambda},
$$
where $\delta f$ is the change in frequency, $v$ is the velocity of the car relative to the radar, $\lambda$ 

### and so on
